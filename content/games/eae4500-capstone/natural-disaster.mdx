## Things I Worked On

#### Entity-Component System Architecture
  - Interactable & Interact Effect Components
  - Landing Point Component
  - Pathway State Component

#### Programming Subsystems - Design and C++ Implementation
  - Interaction Subsystem
  - Pathway Subsystem
  - Scene Subsystem
  - Cosmetics Subsystem

#### Pathway System

I engineered a graph-based system for the game's character pathways. An example of it in action can be seen in the video tutorial I made for the designers on our team on how to use the system's editor interface:

<div class="w-full h-fit justify-center no-prose mt-8">
<div class="aspect-video w-fit mx-auto flex justify-center">

## Background Details

For my senior-year capstone class, 200 students were divided into 16 teams, and each team was tasked with prototyping a game pitch over a period of 2 weeks. The 16 prototypes then were presented to a panel of industry professionals, and that panel selected the top 8 to greenlight into being developed as full games. Natural Disaster was one of those games, and I'm so excited to be in the process of bringing it to life with such a large and talented team of people!

Natural Disaster is currently in its Beta stage, and is set to be released in April 2023. Until then, I'll be working hard with my team to finish the game!
