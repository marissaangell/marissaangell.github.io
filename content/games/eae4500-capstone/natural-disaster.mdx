## Details

For my senior-year capstone class, 200 students were divided into 16 teams, and each team was tasked with prototyping a game pitch over a period of 2 weeks. The 16 prototypes then were presented to a panel of industry professionals, and that panel selected the top 8 to greenlight into being developed as full games. Natural Disaster was one of those games, and I'm so excited to be in the process of bringing it to life with such a large and talented team of people!
