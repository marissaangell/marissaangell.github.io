### Key Project Features:

* 


### My Role(s):

* Vision Holder

	* I came up with the original pitch, which my classmates chose to back

* Lead Gameplay Programmer

	* I managed two additional programmers by delegating them specific tasks and pair programming with them.

	* I designed our overall gameplay systems and did the programming for a great deal of them, including: scarf telekinesis, swinging and hooking movement systems, campfire checkpoints, and the ability unlock system.

* UI Design/Programming

	* As the sole person working on UI, I designed and implemented all of the game's menus and HUD elements. 

* AI Programming

	* I implemented the AI logic for the game's 'Mountain Goat' boss fight.

* VFX

	* I implemented various particle effects, including: simple campfire buring, a localized snow system that follows the player, and particles that mark the location of hook and swing interaction points.

Scarf Girl was the project I completed for the course 'Traditional Game Development,' and was actually the first game I'd ever worked on.
