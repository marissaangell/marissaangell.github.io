## Details

Scarf Girl was the project I completed for the course 'Traditional Game Development' at the University of Utah, and is actually the first game I've ever worked on - it ended up being the first game I've ever completed, too!

## My Role(s) on the Project

Here's a list of some of the areas I worked on during the game's development:


* _Vision Holder_

	* I came up with the original pitch, which my classmates chose to back. I'm very grateful that they were willing to invest their time and effort into the my idea!

* _Gameplay Programmer_

	* I designed our overall gameplay systems and did the programming for a great deal of them, including: scarf telekinesis, swinging and hooking movement systems, campfire checkpoints, and the ability unlock system.

	* I managed our team's task management via Trello, and used it to delegate specific tasks to our artist, level designer, and my 2 fellow programmers. 

* _AI Programming_

	* I implemented the AI logic for the game's 'Mountain Goat' boss fight using UE4's Blackboard system.

* _UI Design/Programming_

	* As the sole person working on UI, I designed and implemented all of the game's menus and HUD elements. 

* _VFX_

	* I implemented various particle effects, including: simple campfire buring, a localized snow system that follows the player, and particles that mark the location of hook and swing interaction points.
