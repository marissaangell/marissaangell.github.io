## Details

Kindling is the project I completed for the course Alternative Game Development at the University of Utah. The goal of the class was to make an 'alt game,' which was a category of games defined for us as "games with a purpose, specifically games that have goals in addition to, or other than, entertainment." Alternative games fall into categories such as educational, health, art, political, subversive, religious, advertising, and more. 

## Team

I worked on Kindling with the following group of lovely people:

* Konny Fung - 2D Art & Animations
* Craig Nash - Level Design & Environment Design
* Vasilisa Miric - Music & Environment Design
* Easton Madsen - Environmental Art & QA
