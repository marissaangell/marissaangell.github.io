## Details

I never thought a writing class would ever have an assignment where you weren't allowed to write anything, but then this project came along.

The class 'Writing for New Media' at the University of Utah was one of my favorite classes precisely because it pushed the boundaries on what I had thought 'writing' really was.


## Teamwork

For this assignment, I worked in a team with three other people. In our group, we had one programmer (myself), one photographer, one digital artist, and one musician. With such a diverse set of artistic talent, as a team we decided to tackle this assignment in a way that would allow all of us to combine our areas of expertise - and this project was the result.
