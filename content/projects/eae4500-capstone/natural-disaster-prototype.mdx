## Details

For my senior-year capstone class, 200 students were divided into 16 teams, and each team was tasked with prototyping a game pitch over a period of 2 weeks. The 16 prototypes then were presented to a panel of industry professionals, and they selected the top 8 to greenlight into being developed as full games.

This prototype build is the result of my team's 2 weeks of work, and is what we presented to that industry panel. If you think our game concept is interesting, you're in luck - we were one of the 8 projects selected to be made into a full game! You can find more info on the state of the game's development below:
