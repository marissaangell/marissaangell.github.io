## Details

I completed this project with a friend and fellow CS major, Brandon Walters - this was our final for the class 'Natural Language Processing' at the University of Utah. Our task was extracting key pieces of information from old business acquisition announcements (i.e. What company was purchased? For how much? By whom?).

Grading for this project was somewhat unique: because the entire class was working to maximize accuracy and precision on the same data set, we were ranked against each other as a sort of class competition. In the end, the top 10 teams presented their program architecture and problem solving strategies for everyone to learn from - and Brandon and I ended up getting 6th overall! Some excerpts from our presentation are included in the slideshow above.
